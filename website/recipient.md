Our volunteers will arrive on November 15th between 9 - 11AM.  They will bring all their own equipment, rake your leaves into bags, and place them at your normal pickup location.

If you have a dog/cat they must be inside during the rake, and **all animal waste must be picked up prior to raking**.  If there is animal waste in the yard our volunteers will leave and not reschedule.
