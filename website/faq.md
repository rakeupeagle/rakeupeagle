Please confine your animal during the time that the team is at your home. Also, *make sure all animal waste is picked up.*  **If there is animal waste in the yard, the team will not rake your yard.**

### What if the team comes before all of my leaves fall?
Rake Up Eagle is a single-day event, so you'll need to make other arrangements for late-falling leaves.

Our teams will rake on EVENT_DATE. If there is inclement weather on that date, we'll do our best to schedule for a later time.

### What supplies does Rake Up Eagle supply for the volunteers?

### What do we do if it rains/snows on or before Rake Up Eagle?
We ask that all teams get the raking done as soon as possible, preferably within a week of EVENT_DATE. If you absolutely cannot reschedule, please contact Rake Up Eagle to reassign the yard. Please also watch for texts from Rake Up Eagle PTO with instructions if weather becomes an issue.
