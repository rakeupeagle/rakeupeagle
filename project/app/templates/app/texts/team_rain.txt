*Important Rake Up Eagle Notice*

Thank you for serving as a Volunteer Team Leader.  Obviously with the near-constant rain we expect unfavorable conditions for raking tomorrow (Saturday.)  If you wish to reschedule, that is perfectly fine!  We simply ask the following:

- Pick up your lawn bags and assignment at Eagle Middle School tomorrow between 9-10.
- Complete your assignment by next week.
- Contact your assignee tomorrow to let them know which day you plan to rake.

Thank you for giving your time and kindness to our Eagle neighbors.  We couldnâ€™t pull off this community service without YOU!
