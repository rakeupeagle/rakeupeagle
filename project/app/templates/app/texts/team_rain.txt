*Important Rake Up Eagle Notice*

Thank you for serving as a Volunteer Team Leader.  Obviously with the near-constant rain we expect unfavorable conditions for raking tomorrow (Saturday.)  If you wish to reschedule, that is perfectly fine!  We simply ask the following:

- Pick up your lawn bags and assignment at Eagle Middle School tomorrow between 8-10.
- Complete your assignment by next week.
- Contact your assignee tomorrow to let them know which day you plan to rake.

Thank you for giving your time and kindness to our Eagle neighbors.  We couldn’t pull off this community service without YOU!
