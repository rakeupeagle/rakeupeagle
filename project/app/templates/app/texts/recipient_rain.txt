*Important Rake Up Eagle {{instance.event.date|date:'Y'}} Notice*

Thank you for signing up for Rake Up Eagle.  

With the near-constant rain raking will be difficult tomorrow.  As such, we've given each team the ability to reschedule raking your property.

This decision will be up to each team leader.  If conditions allow, they may arrive tomorrow and rake as planned, or they may choose another day this week to rake.  Either way you should hear from your team leader tomorrow.  

If you don't hear back please let us know and we'll do our best to reassign your property.  

Sorry for the adjustments, but Mother Nature sometimes has other plans for us...

Thank you so much!

Rake Up Eagle
