We show your team as having checked-in, which means you have your bags and assignment.

If you are working on/finished your assignment today, please let us know how many bags you used.  Also please let us know if your workload was too much, too little, or just right.

If you are working on your assignment later this week/next weekend, please let us know that you've confirmed that with your recipient.

Any other questions?  Need help?  Let us know!

Thank you so much!
