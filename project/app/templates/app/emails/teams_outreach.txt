Greetings from Rake Up Eagle!

You're receiving this message because we show that last year you were
a team in the Rake Up Eagle project, sponsored by the Eagle
Middle School PTO.

We're doing it again this year and are inviting you to participate. We
have the bags, the deserving recipients who need some help with
raking their yards -- all we need is you!

The event is on November 9th starting at 8AM.  We'll meet at Eagle
Middle School for donuts and coffee, hand out assignments and bags,
and then send you off to the house of a senior, veteran, or disabled
resident of Eagle to rake their yard, bag the leaves, and place the
bags for pickup.  You need to bring your own gloves, rakes, etc. --
we take care of the rest.

If this sounds good to you, then Signup today before the November 5th
deadline.

Hope to see you on November 9th!

Rake Up Eagle
